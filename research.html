        <b>Moment tensor inversions<br>
        </b>Moment tensor is a way of quantifying the relative motion on
        a planar fault and is represented by a 4-quadrant beachball that
        roughly mimics the pattern of the radiating wavefield. <br>
        The best moment tensor is obtained by minimizing the difference
        between the data with the synthetics.&nbsp; The synthetics are
        computed for all possible moment tensors using a 1D reference
        structural model. Different bandpass filters are applied to the
        body waves and surface waves when comparing the data with the
        synthetics. <br>

        <b>Uncertainties in moment tensors</b><br>
        The confidence in moment tensor is quantified by comparing the
        normalized distribution of posterior samples, P(ω), with the
        normalized distribution of all samples, V(ω), where ω is a angle
        between two moment tensors. <br>

            defined in terms of V(ω) and P(ω) by requiring that P(V) =
            P(ω) when V(ω) = V , as indicated by the arrows. The number
            V(ω) is the fractional volume of the neighborhood NM0 (ω) of
            moment tensors within angular distance ω of M0 , and P(ω) is
            likewise the probability of NM0 (ω). Hence, P(V) is the
            probability that the true moment tensor for the earthquake
            lies in the neighborhood of M0 that has volume V ; large

        <b>Very low frequency earthquakes (VLFE)</b><br>
        Compared to a normal earthquake of Mw 4 which has a source
        duration of ~1 second, duration for VLFEs of a similar magnitude
        event could go upto 15 seconds as in this case. Due to the lack
        of the high-frequency content many-a-times these events go
        undetected. The characteristic of a VLFE is the energy
        distribution in the long period (low frequency) of the spectrum,
        which allows one to perform source inversion using long-period
        surface waves. <br>
        For estimating the best source duration we search over varying
        bandpass and source duration. <br>

        <b>Moment tensor catalog of Alaska<br>
        </b>For performing a earthquake based tomographic inversion it
        is important to have reliable source mechanisms. We prepared a
        moment tensor catalog of &gt;200 events (2007-2017) that are
        distributed in Alaska. <br>
        Undergraduate researchers Qingping Yu and Joshua Purba also
        contributed to this.<br>

        <b>Hidden faults<br>
        </b>Distribution of moment tensors of similar mechanism in a
        clustered seismic zone can be used as a strong evidence for the
        presence of a fault. This is specially useful when faults are
        sub-surface or overlain by a layer of sediment as in a basin
        environment and there is no surface feature. <br>
        Moment tensor along with gravity and magnetic measurements are
        used to study the tectonic setting of such seismic zones. <br>
